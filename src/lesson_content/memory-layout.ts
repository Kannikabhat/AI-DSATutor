      content: "Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations. This means if the first element is at address 1000, and each element takes 4 bytes, then the second element will be at address 1004, the third at 1008, and so on."

      yesNoFeedback: {
        yes: "Exactly right! Contiguous storage enables cache locality, predictable memory access patterns, and allows for direct address calculation using the formula: base_address + (index Ã— element_size).",
        no: "Actually, it provides significant benefits! Contiguous storage improves cache performance, enables direct address calculation, and makes memory access patterns predictable for the CPU."
